The noise of the audible glamer at this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an audible glamer spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.\n\nA character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound, emanating from the caster's direction. \n\nNote that this spell can enhance the effectiveness of the phantasmal force spell.\n\nThe material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax.",

Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. \nWhatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. \n\nCommon tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. Combined with the unseen servant spell, these are the tools to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard.",

If trying to summon a specific key, the caster would need to be positioned closer to that key than to any others, including keys they may have on their person. The spell will not cross planes or pull items from extra dimensional space, such as from within a bag of holding or a portable hole.\n\nObjects that are worn or held are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid being pulled (using the save of their wearer).",

    "description": "This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object, increasing both size and weight. It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed ten cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected.\n\n \nIt grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight. Magical properties are not increased by this spell - a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stein would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionally with size. \n\nFor example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.\n\nThe reverse spell, reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by one-foot increments to less than one foot, by one-inch increments to one inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch - the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.\n\nFor example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.\n\nA rowboat that has a length of 14', a depth of 2', and a beam of 4' has a volume of 112 cubic feet. A rough volume measurement for a humanoid is: height cubed, divided by 24 (h³/24).\n\nThe material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron.",

Only one function of a multi-function item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5-th level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell.\n\nThe item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charges ring of three wishes always appears to be only faintly charged.\n\nAfter casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution.

If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multi-functional item can be learned from a single reading.\n\nAt the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned.",

Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function, but if cast directly against magical darkness negates it (but only for the duration of the light spell, if the darkness effect is continual).\n\nLight centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack rolls and saving throws by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster can end the spell at any time by uttering a single word. \n\nThe material component is a firefly or a piece of phosphorescent moss.",

Once discovered this way, it is known forever.\n\nDetect Magic: When cast on an item with a Beacon spell, the signature resonance of the beacon can be learned for the duration of Detect Magic and picked up on at a range of 1 mile per level. For example, an adventuring party comes across some loot. The wizard of the party detects magic and sees that the ring in the pile is not only magical, but it has a beacon on it! Before they can pick it up, the rogue takes the ring and runs away. Fur the duration of Detect Magic, the wizard will be able to pick up on that beacon (provided they are looking in the right direction of course), at a range of up to 1 mile per level. Once the Detect Magic spell wears off, the beacon's signature is lost.\n\nLocate Object: If the signature of a beacon is known, Locate Object will pick up on the beacon at a range of 1 mile per level. For example, Ginger the Enchanter has created a beacon on a necklace she's given to her younger sister.

The answer is then returned to the caster as long as the location is on the current plane of existence, and there is a general consensus from the creatures in the area. Landmarks must be stationary and singular. Should a stationary landmark be moved, perhaps the \"Great Tree of Vitality\" has been cut down and moved, the original location of the landmark as it is known to people in the range of the spell is used. Mobile landmarks, like a King's Crown, automatically fail.\n\n\nIn preparation for this spell, an 10' diameter area must be prepared. If an area has already been prepared (such as a dedicated divination room within a wizard's lair), the spell can be cast straight away taking only 4 hours. If such an area must be constructed, the area must be made uniform and neat. A wheel must be carefully inscribed on the outside with radial spikes to the center. This can be etched, painted, or even made with sticks in a pinch, but the preparation and placement must be exact. In optimal conditions, this takes 2 hours (e.g. paint on an empty warehouse floor). In ordinary conditions, this takes 4 hours (e.g. etching on flat stone). In poor conditions, this takes 6 hours (e.g. sticks and leaves in the forest floor). If the caster is in a hurry, they may use half the prep time with a successful intelligence check. If the check is failed, the caster has not prepared the area correctly and the spell flubs. Generally it is best to roll the intelligence as the spell is being cast.\n\nThe actual casting of the spell takes 4 hours, during which time the caster must sit still in the center of the wheel with their eyes closed and their mind in an open state. They cannot carry conversation or interact with objects without flubbing the spell. The magic sweeps the area in an apparently haphazard manner before returning to the caster a direction (if the spell is successful). \n\nExample: Bobo the diviner casts Locate Landmark, with the landmark in question being the secret burial ground of elves. Bobo is in a human dominated region, where nobody knows the answer to this question, so it returns no answer. Bobo then decides to head to a major port where there are many elves, and casts the spell again. The compass in his hand turns to point North West. Bobo doesn't know how far North West it is, so he travels North West for six days before casting the spell again. This time he is in a small elvan port town that allows human visitors. He casts the spell again, and gets a direction of south west. Bobo knows he's overshot the distance, and can change directions, heading south this time.\n\nA very careful wizard with a compass and map might be able to triangulate the location of a landmark, although this can be tricky since the further the target is from the landmark, the more the compass needle wobbles.

The key vanishes when the caster loses light concentration, but until then acts in all respects as a normal key.\n\n\nThe key created is of the same volume as the key used in the component. While locks on homes and chests tend to be of similar size, desk locks tend to have smaller keys, and gates tend to have larger keys. Too much material in the spell component is usually possible to work around, perhaps producing a key with a large handle, but having too small of a spell component can lead to unusable results for large keyed locks.\n\nIt is possible to intentionally flub the spell and produce a key that does not work on the door. This flubbed key will be of a type that would work in the door, but with the wrong configuration.",

The message, which must be of 25 words or less, can be in any language known by the spellcaster, and can be delivered over a period of one turn. \n\n\nThe mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words. It does, however, move to the words articulated - if it is placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms. \n\nThe spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster. \n\nSome examples are to speak \"to the first creature that touches you,\" or \"to the first creature that passes within 30 feet.\" Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: \"Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot.\" Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards (\"Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards.\"). \n\nThe spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a small bit of honeycomb.",

The first version of this spell enchants the wards permanently, while the second version permits their use.\n\n\nTwo masks must be created, one that looks outward, and one that looks inward. The outward facing mask has the shape of a person, animal, or monster as seen by another person - a typical face. The masks that look in are shaped as if to be donned, but must also match the outward mask. When the wizard \"wears\" the inward mask and casts the spell they see as if their face was the outward mask. They cannot move the outward mask, but may move the eyes, which might be noticed by someone observing the outward mask.\n\nThe second version of the spell has a duration of 1 round / level, during which time the wizard may switch between various masks if they have more than one.\n\nShould a mask be damaged, it may cease to function. This is checked the first time the mask is used after being damaged. A mask 10% damaged has a 10% chance of failing. If this check is passed, it will continue to function until further damaged. Damage to the gems that function as eyes destroyed the magic.",

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points - floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc., or the web collapses upon itself and disappears.\n\n\nThe web spell covers a maximum area of eight 10' x 10' x 10' cubes and the webs must be at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. \n\nAnyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, two things may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape the area, then it is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape, then the webs are only half strength. Creatures with less than 13 Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are stuck until freed by another or until the spell wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective against creatures trapped in webs.\n\nCreatures with Strengths between 13 and 17 can break through 1 foot of webs per round. Creatures with 18 or greater Strength can break through 2 feet of webs per round. If the webs are at half strength, these rates are doubled. (Great mass equates to great strength in this case, and creatures of large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong and huge creatures can break through 10 feet of webs per round.\n\nFurthermore, the strands of a web spell are flammable. A magical flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire - torch, flaming oil, flaming sword, etc. - can set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within flaming webs suffer 2d4 points of damage from the flames, but those free of the strands are not harmed.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a bit of spider web.",

The caster will need a beacon to lock onto, a high quality and accurate map of the region the beacon is suspected to be in, and a crystal lens worth 50gp that is consumed in the casting.\n\n\nIf the beacon was created by the caster, no unusual preparations are needed; but if the beacon was created by another caster, then she must first cast Locate Beacon on the beacon itself. Preparation similar to that of Identify must be undertaken, clearing and cleaning a space, having silence and stillness, and ridding the room of any other magical items. After the cleansing is done, the Locate Beacon spell can be cast on the enchanted object to understand its resonance, and prepare the caster to seek it out later. Once prepared in this way, the caster need never prepare or attune to the beacon again. An Identify spell cast on the enchanted object will also work to link to the beacon.\n\nWhen a beacon is to be located, a map must be produced and the crystal lens placed on it. The Locate Beacon spell is cast on both the map and the lens (just the one casting) and the caster may then look through the lens at the map to find its location. If the map is detailed and accurate enough, and the beacon is somewhere depicted on the map, it will be seen as a pulsing green light about 1\" in diameter. The beacon is within the area of the light, but not exactly at its center. Two casters locating the same beacon on two different maps, one twice the size of the other and covering the same region, will have two different tolerances. A caster using a desk sized map of the world may only be able to pin the beacon down to a single kingdom. A map of that kingdom might reveal the beacon is in or near a specific city. A map of that city might reveal the beacon is in a neighborhood or perhaps a specific building, depending on specific circumstances.\n\nThe map must be well made, well informed, accurate, and precise. Maps of this quality are often at least 100gp in value. \n\nBeacon and Locate Beacon are often used by powerful merchants and nobles to track larges shipments of money. A single coin may be made a beacon, tossed in with the rest, and if the shipment doesn't get to where it was heading, can be tracked down hopefully before too much is spent or distributed.",

Any damage inflicted by the caster or his allies in the round of casting grants the wounded creature another saving throw at a bonus of +1 per point of damage received. \nAny affected creature regards the spellcaster as friendly, an ally or companion to be treated well or guarded from harm. \nIf communication is possible, the charmed creature follows reasonable requests, instructions, or orders most faithfully (see the suggestion spell). \n\nIf communication is not possible, the creature does not harm the caster, but others in the vicinity may be subject to its intentions, hostile or otherwise. Any overtly hostile act by the caster breaks the spell, or at the very least allows a new saving throw against the charm. \n\nAffected creatures eventually come out from under the influence of the spell. This is a function of the creature's level (i.e., its Hit Dice).\n\n1st level or up to 2 Hit Dice Monsters have a 5% chance per week of breaking the spell.\n2nd level or up to 3+2 Hit Dice Monsters have a 10% chance per week of breaking the spell.\n3rd level or up to 4+4 Hit Dice Monsters have a 15% chance per week of breaking the spell.\n4th level or up to 6 Hit Dice Monsters have a 25% chance per week of breaking the spell.\n6th level or up to 7+2 Hit Dice Monsters have a 35% chance per week of breaking the spell.\n6th level or up to 8+4 Hit Dice Monsters have a 45% chance per week of breaking the spell.\n7th level or up to 10 Hit Dice Monsters have a 60% chance per week of breaking the spell.\n8th level or up to 12 Hit Dice Monsters have a 75% chance per week of breaking the spell.\n9th level or over 12 Hit Dice Monsters have a 90% chance per week of breaking the spell.\n\nThe exact day of the week and time of day is secretly determined.",

The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one creature per caster level. \n\nThese creatures are allowed saving throws vs. spell with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Confused creatures react as follows (roll 1d10):\n\n1 Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell\n2-6 Stand confused one round (then roll again)\n7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again)\n10 Act normally for one round (then roll again)\n\nThe spell lasts for two rounds plus one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail are checked by the DM for actions each round for the duration of the spell, or until the \"wander away for the duration of the spell\" result occurs.\n\nWandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.\n\nIf there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to make the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded. Out of the other 12, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused, and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two attacking the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stand confused, four attack, and one acts normally.\n\nThe material component is a set of three nut shells.",

The chest will only form if there is a surface for it to rest on.\n\n\nThe chest is unlocked and any items that can fit inside may be placed in there. Once the caster has placed what they want in the chest, they can close the lid and remove the key. Once the key is removed, the chest vanishes into a small dimensional pocket where it is untouchable by any but extreme means. The key remains on the same plane as the caster. This key, when placed in any lock by any creature, will summon the chest at the feet (or nearby flat surface) of its holder, and the key will dissolve. The chest will fizzle after 5 minutes unless the Dimensional Chest spell is cast again, in which case the same chest can be sent back without having to move items between chests. A fizzled chest dumps its contents where the chest was resting.\n\nThe chest will say in extra dimensional space until recalled. Should a wizard lockup their goods and then be eaten by a large creature, it may be many years or centuries until someone finds the key again, but the chest will still be waiting. The extra dimensional chest space is only as large as the chest and the only air there is what is in the chest. Living creatures should not be put in the chest if they wish to survive.\n\nWhile the chest is in extra dimensional space, the key used to summon it radiates moderate magical energy. The key is almost indestructible, but if destroyed immediately summons the chest back at the point of its destruction. If the key is tossed into a pit of lave, it will be destroyed, the chest will be summoned into the pit of lava, and all items in the chest will (more than likely) be destroyed too.",

Hopelessness: The affected creatures submit to the demands of any opponent: surrender, get out, etc. Otherwise, the creatures are 25% likely to do nothing in a round, and 25% likely to turn back or retreat. It counters (and is countered by) hope.\n\n8. Sadness: This creates unhappiness and a tendency toward maudlin introspection. This emotion penalizes surprise rolls by -1 and adds +1 to initiative rolls.

    "description": "The polymorph other spell is a powerful magic that completely alters the form and ability, and possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, while a creature with a lower Intelligence can be polymorphed in form into something with a higher Intelligence, it will not gain that creature's mental ability. \n\n\nThe reverse - polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower Intelligence - results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives the change. After this, it must make a special Intelligence check to see if it retains its personality (see following).\n\nThe polymorphed creature acquires the and physical abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, etc.).\n\nHit points and saving throws do not change from the original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters (lycanthropes, doppelgangers, higher level druids, etc.) are affected for but one round, and can then resume their normal form.\nIf slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form (it's still dead, though). (Note that most creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As class and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified.\n\nWhen the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (e.g., -2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.\n\nWhen the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subjects personality and mentality change into that of new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of difference between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels) or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes place.\n\nA subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until recovered by a wish spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form's full range of magical and special abilities.\n\nExample: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 85% (20- 8 Intelligence + 5 levels difference [16-1]=17 out of 20= 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well.\n\nThe wizard can use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions will most likely consider him mad.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon.",

(To determine this, roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply the hit points by 0.2. Any remainder less than 0.4 is dropped - in the case of monsters with 1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the monster was not successfully created - and scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 hit point.)\nThose viewing the shadow monsters are allowed to disbelieve as per normal illusions, although there is a -2 penalty to the attempt. The shadow monsters perform as the real monsters with respect to Armor Class and attack forms. Those who believe in the shadow monsters suffer real damage from their attacks. Special attack forms such as petrification or level drain do not actually occur, but a subject who believes they are real will react appropriately.\n\nThose who roll successful saving throws see the shadow monsters as transparent images superimposed on vague shadowy forms. These are Armor Class 10 and inflict only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional damage less than 0.4 as done with hit points.\n\nExample: A shadow monster griffon attacks a person who knows it is only quasi-real. The monster strikes with two claw attacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die monster. All three attacks hit, and the normal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by 0.2 separately, rounded up or down, then added together to get total damage. Thus if the attacks score 4, 2, and 11 points, then a total of 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x 0.2 = 0.8 [rounded to 1], 2 x 0.2 = 0.4 [rounded to 1], 11 x 0.2 = 2.2 [rounded to 2].

The wizard eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. \n\nIt has substance and a form that can be detected (by a detect invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye, although it can pass through a space no smaller than a small mouse hole (one inch in diameter).\n\nUsing the eye requires the wizard to concentrate. However, if his concentration is broken, the spell does not end - the eye merely becomes inert until the wizard again concentrates, subject to the duration of the spell. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. \n\nA successful dispel cast on the wizard or eye ends the spell. With respect to blindness, magical darkness, and so on, the wizard eye is considered an independent sensory organ of the caster.\n\nThe material component of the spell is a bit of bat fur.",

    "description": "By means of this spell, the wizard splits the reality of an object. While retaining the same basic form, the object is divided into two entities, each of half the mass of the original. Both objects are one and the same, only existing in both places, half way, at the same time. What one experiences, so does the other - but that experience is relative only to the object. For example, a tablet with soft clay inlaid could be written on and the text would appear on the other in real time; however; a tablet turned upside down, lifted, thrown, moved, or otherwise translated does not affect the positioning, rotation, or velocity of the other. A sword thusly split could be wielded in battle by two different people without problem.\n\n\nHowever, this split existence is extremely fragile. While each object is the same size as the whole form, it only contains half the mass, an thus has half the strength, durability, and weight. A sword split by this spell would be fragile and of little value in combat. Any blow to the subject must roll its enchanter's level or less on a d20 or the item breaks the spell. Any damage, mutation, or phase change to the item breaks the spell. Blinking, teleporting, plane shifting, crossing extradimensional boundaries, or being effected by any number of spells breaks the spell. Such spells include, but are not limited to: Haste, enlarge, magic mouth, dispel magic, and any successful attack spell.\n\nWhen the spell is broken the object fully materializes in one place and vanishes from the other. If the object realizes in the place where the action that broke the spell exists, the object suffers the normal effects it would there. A clay tablet made duo and struck with a sword has an equal chance of realizing either in the path of the sword, or in its other place - potentially being destroyed in the first case and presumably safe in the second.\n\nAnd Identify or Locate Beacon spell may reveal the location of the other reality when cast on an item split by this spell. For Identify, treat the location of the object as a property to be checked for. For Locate Beacon, an intelligence check is needed. This check can be made once per level.",

    "description": "By means of this spell, the wizard is able to move objects by concentrating on moving them mentally. The spell can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust.\n\n\nA sustained force enables the wizard to move a weight of up to 25 pounds a distance up to 20 feet per round. The spell lasts two rounds, plus one round per caster level. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object moved beyond the caster's range falls or stops. If the caster ceases concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. The object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. The caster might even be able to untie simple knots, at the discretion of the DM.\n\nAlternatively, the spell energy can be expended in a single round. The caster can hurl one or more objects within range, and within a 10-foot cube, directly away from himself at high speed, to a distance of up to 10 feet per caster level. This is subject to a maximum weight of 25 pounds per caster level. Damage caused by hurled objects is decided by the DM, but cannot exceed 1 point of damage per caster level. Opponents who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. Furthermore, those able to employ as simple a counter-measure as an enlarge spell, for example (thus making the body weight go over the maximum spell limit), can easily counter the spell. The various Bigby's hand spells also counter this spell.",

The area is also impervious to breath weapons, gaze or voice attacks, and similar special attack forms.\n\n\nThe antimagic shell also hedges out charmed, summoned, or conjured creatures.

Furthermore, while a magical sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword. Note that creatures on their home plane are normal creatures there. Thus, on the Elemental Plane of Fire, a randomly encountered fire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this spell. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\n\nShould the caster be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, parts of his person may be considered exposed, at the DM's option.

If only detailed information on the person, place, or thing is known, casting time is 1d10 days. If only rumors are known, casting time is 2d6 weeks.\n\n\nDuring the casting, the wizard cannot engage in activities other than the routine: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination reveals if legendary material is available. It often reveals where this material is--by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It sometimes gives certain information regarding the person, place, or thing (when the object of the legend lore is at hand), but this data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). Naturally, a legend lore spell reveals information only if the person, place, or thing is noteworthy or legendary.\n\nFor example, suppose Delsenora came across an extremely well-made sword. It radiates magic, but when she used an identify spell, she could not learn any information. Even giving it to a trusted fighter didn't work, as the sword did not reveal any special powers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, hoping to gain more information. Since the sword is at hand, she completes the spell in three turns. In her mind comes the message, \"Once this was the sword of he who waits till Albion's time of greatest peril, when unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the hand that gave me and fair was the hand that reclaimed me.\" Clearly, Delsenora realizes, this must be a very powerful item, since her spell gave only a cryptic answer. But who is he who waits? And where is Albion? For more information, Delsenora is going to have to cast more spells. But now the process will take much longer, since she has only the vaguest of clues to follow.\n\nThe legend lore spell is cast with incense and strips of ivory formed into a rectangle, but some item of value to the caster must be sacrificed in addition--a potion, magical scroll, magical item, etc.",

The caster chooses a location and a time when enchanting the first handful of sand, and can change location and time with each subsequent imbued handful they add to the fire.\n\nThe location must be public, something generally accessible to anyone, unless the caster adds to the fire a flammable personal affect of a specific person whose past they wish to view. The item should be relatively whole and personal in nature. Alternatively, a drop of blood or the root of a hair, freshly procured in the last 24 hours, may be used in lieu of a personal item. The location can be changed with a handful of sand. Regardless whether the caster is viewing a public area, or a specific person, a room lined with lead or silver will block the spell and the caster will see nothing but flames.\n\nThe time frame is limited to the past, viewed in real time, and limited to increments of exactly 1 year. Should a caster wish to view the events of the previous day, they would have to wait a year minus a day to see them. The time may be changed with a handful of sand to any increment of 1 year that they wish.\n\nPostcognition can be channeled for as long as the caster is no more than 15 from the flames, their intensity is maintained, and the caster maintains concentration on the spell. They may converse with those around them as long as it is about what is happening in the fires. Other conversation is too distracting and will cause the caster to falter. Taking damage requires making a saving throw to maintain concentration.\n\nBecause the onlooker sees the events only where flames are, one bigger or closer the flames, the better view the onlooker will have.
